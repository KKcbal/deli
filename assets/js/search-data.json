In general, we start with lists since understanding lists is an important step in understanding iteration. . 3.10 - Lists . Here are some key takeaways. . Lists are a good way to organize and collect data in a program, as they allow a set of potentially very different items to be found within one object. | Items in lists are located with indexes, which, in most code languages, start with 0 (though the pseudocode used by CollegeBoard usually starts at 1!). | Using functions like append(), pop(), and insert(), you can add new things to a list. | Keeping items within lists allow you to apply a function to each item of a list using iteration. | . 3.8 - Iteration . Here are some key takeaways. . Iteration is the repetition of a function. Allowing a function to repeat on its own based on various conditions can vastly optimize a program. | Iteration is most often done with loops, typically in combination with lists and/or dictionaries. | There are multiple types of loops, and while most types can, in some way, do the same thing as other types, some things are simpler to do with certain loops than others. | .",

            "content": "What is Iteration? . Iteration is basically repetition. In code, it is always helpful to have a system in place to repeat a function a certain amount of times, because copy-pasting functions over and over is both unnecessary complicated and unprofessional. . Pretty much every single code language uses loops of some kind, but in this lesson, we use Python because it has a very learning-friendly syntax. . Conditional Iteration . Most of the time, a function iterates a certain number of times based on the purpose it&#39;s supposed to serve. For example, if your function is supposed to multiply a number by 8 four times, you could do something like this, but you definitely shouldn&#39;t. . number = 2 def multiplyby8(num): global newnum newnum = num * 8 print(newnum) print(&#39;Multiplying&#39;, number, &#39;by 8 four times:&#39;) multiplyby8(number) multiplyby8(newnum) multiplyby8(newnum) multiplyby8(newnum) . Multiplying 2 by 8 four times: 16 128 1024 8192 . Instead, automate the process using loops. In this case, we used a &quot;while&quot; loop. There will be more about loops later in the second part of this lesson. The function loops until the condition of the function having been repeated 4 times is satisfied. . number = 2 def multiplyby8_4times(num): print(&#39;Multiplying&#39;, num, &#39;by 8 four times:&#39;) i = 0 #i starts at 0 while i &lt; 4: #the function will repeat until i &gt;= 4 num = num * 8 print(num) i += 1 #i increments each time multiplyby8_4times(number) . Multiplying 2 by 8 four times: 16 128 1024 8192 . (It would actually be more efficient to just multiply the number by 4096 or 84, but this is just for demonstration.) . Iteration Based on Lists and Dictionaries . Most code languages have some form of &quot;for&quot; loop. This type of loop checks the information stored within a list and prints it accordingly. . numlist = [1, 2, 3, 4] #more numbers = increase the amount of times it iterates #since numlist is a list of single numbers, it understands &#39;number&#39; as each number for number in numlist: prod = number * 2 print(str(number), &quot;times 2 is equal to&quot;, str(prod) + &quot;.&quot;) . 1 times 2 is equal to 2. 2 times 2 is equal to 4. 3 times 2 is equal to 6. 4 times 2 is equal to 8. . Lists with multiple items at each index can be formatted like this. . petlist = [(&quot;Dogs&quot;, 1), (&quot;Cats&quot;, 2), (&quot;Fish&quot;, 0)] print(&quot;Your pets:&quot;) for pet, number in petlist: #in order, the first and then the second print(pet + &quot;: &quot;, number) . Your pets: Dogs: 1 Cats: 2 Fish: 0 . In cases like this, however, it is usually preferable to use a dictionary. This makes the information clearer. . Using multiple loops, we can even dig deeper into collections of information during a &quot;for&quot; loop like in the example below. . drewpets = [(&quot;Drew&quot;, ({&quot;dogs&quot;: 1, &quot;cats&quot;: 1, &quot;fish&quot;: 0}))] ajpets = [(&quot;AJ&quot;, {&quot;dogs&quot;: 1, &quot;cats&quot;: 0, &quot;fish&quot;: 329})] johnnypets = [(&quot;Johnny&quot;, {&quot;dogs&quot;: 2, &quot;cats&quot;: 0, &quot;fish&quot;: 0})] allpets = [drewpets, ajpets, johnnypets] #a collection of all pet lists for person in allpets: for name, dict in person: #unpacking the name and dictionary print(name + &quot;&#39;s pets:&quot;) for pet, num in dict.items(): #use .items() to go through keys and values print(pet.capitalize() + &quot;:&quot;, num) #capitalizes first letter print(&quot;&quot;) . Try running this on your own and see if you can understand it. . Hack opportunity: make your own function that uses multiple &quot;for&quot; loops within each other to unpack and display elements in a list. .",

            "content": "For Loops . These loops are good for applying a certain alogrithm or function to an entire list of similar things. However, how many times the function iterates is not as controllable. . We already talked a bit about them in the previous iteration lesson, so here&#39;s a review. . list = [&quot;cheese&quot;, 328, 3.1415926, True] # This for loop show what the type of everything in the list is for thing in list: print(type(thing)) . &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;float&#39;&gt; &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . For loops are mostly useful for applying a function to everything in a list one-by-one. It&#39;s technically possible to make for loops act the same as other loops, but it often takes a lot more work-arounds. . numlist = [3, 6, 93, 247, 33338, 32, 211] newlist = [] for number in numlist: #this loop generates a new list with the numlist values divided by 2 newlist.append(number / 2) print(newlist) #it is more difficult, for example, to detect the index of the list objects newerlist = [] index = 0 #with this loop, this new variable is necessary for number in numlist: #this only applies the division to even indexes if index % 2 == 0: newerlist.append(number / 2) else: newerlist.append(number) index += 1 print(newerlist) .

Recursive loops can be created in multiple different ways, and involve incrementing a variable until it reaches a certain break point. This can be a good type of loop to use when you want to limit the starting point, for example. . list = [&quot;Benjamin&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Lightbulbs&quot;, &quot;Kites&quot;, &quot;Scams&quot;] def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(list): print(list[i]) recursive_loop(i+1) else: return # This will print the whole list recursive_loop(0) print(&quot;&quot;) # This will print only the last three things print(&quot;Things associated with Benjamin Franklin:&quot;) recursive_loop(2) . Benjamin Franklin Lightbulbs Kites Scams Things associated with Benjamin Franklin: Lightbulbs Kites Scams . Unlike the for loop from before, because i always represents the current index of the list in question, we don&#39;t need to include the extra index variable. . numlist = [3, 6, 93, 247, 33338, 32, 211] newerlist = [] def recursive_num(i): if i &lt; len(numlist): if i % 2 == 0: newerlist.append(numlist[i] / 2) else: newerlist.append(numlist[i]) recursive_num(i + 1) else: print(newerlist) #even though we were able to omit that index variable, #some would argue this is more complicated recursive_num(0) . [1.5, 6, 46.5, 247, 16669.0, 32, 105.5] . While Loops . While loops are very similar to recursive loops, but with a different syntax. . While loops don&#39;t require a function that is then called again within the original function until a condition is met. While functions perform all the way through, and if the condition is still satisfied afterward, the while loop will repeat again. . list = [&quot;Sample&quot;, &quot;Text&quot;, &quot;For&quot;, &quot;Learning&quot;] def while_loop(): i = 0 while i &lt; len(list): print(list[i]) i += 1 # This will print the whole list while_loop() . Sample Text For Learning . And here&#39;s a while loop version of the function from before. . numlist = [3, 6, 93, 247, 33338, 32, 211] newerlist = [] def while_num(): i = 0 while i &lt; len(numlist): if i % 2 == 0: newerlist.append(numlist[i] / 2) else: newerlist.append(numlist[i]) i += 1 print(newerlist) #this version has a bit less clutter than recursive with one less if/else while_num() . [1.5, 6, 46.5, 247, 16669.0, 32, 105.5] . Challenge . This isn&#39;t the homework, but doing this and showing it on your review ticket will definitely boost your grade! You&#39;ll have time to work on it during the lesson. . Create a loop that converts 8-bit binary values from a list into decimal numbers. Then, after the value is determined, remove all the values greater than 100 from the list using a list-related function you&#39;ve been taught before. Print the new list when done. . Once you&#39;ve done this with one of the types of loops discussed in this lesson, create a function that does the same thing with a different type of loop. . binarylist = [ &quot;01001001&quot;, &quot;10101010&quot;, &quot;10010110&quot;, &quot;00110111&quot;, &quot;11101100&quot;, &quot;11010001&quot;, &quot;10000001&quot; ] def binary_convert(binary): pass #use this function to convert every binary value in binarylist to decimal #afterward, get rid of the values that are greater than 100 in decimal #when done, print the results .

The videos use a fake coding language that doesn&#39;t really have a 1:1 translation to python or javascript. The other two videos were talking about REPEAT functions and REPEAT UNTIL functions. The repeat function will repeat a function a set number of times and the repeat until is basically a while function . list = [1, 2, 3, 4] for n in list: print(&quot;i&quot;) . i i i i .
