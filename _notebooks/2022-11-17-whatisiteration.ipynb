    "\n",
    "Iteration is basically repetition. In code, it is always helpful to have a system in place to repeat a function a certain amount of times, because copy-pasting functions over and over is both unnecessary complicated and unprofessional.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pretty much every single code language uses loops of some kind, but in this lesson, we use Python because it has a very learning-friendly syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time, a function iterates a certain number of times based on the purpose it's supposed to serve. For example, if your function is supposed to multiply a number by 8 four times, you *could* do something like this, but <mark>you definitely shouldn't</mark>."
